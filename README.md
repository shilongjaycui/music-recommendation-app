# `snowflake-demo-app`
Based on your 5 favorite artists/genres/songs, here are the 100 songs that you're likely to also enjoy!

## Why (purpose)
To always have 100 songs that you're like to enjoy and know how they're related to one another ðŸ”Ž ðŸ¤¨

## What (requirements)
- **Data Warehouse:** Structured data of the recommended songs based on your seed artists/genres/songs
- **Data Integration** Data fetching mechanism that talks to the Spotify Web API every day
- **AI / ML:** Now, how are those recommended songs similar to and different from one another? And in what ways?
  - maybe: integrate with [DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com/)

## How (implementation)
- [x] version control: Git, GitHub
- [x] API: Python, [Snowflake Connector for Python](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector), [Spotipy](https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy) (a lightweight Python library for the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api))
- [x] UI: Streamlit
