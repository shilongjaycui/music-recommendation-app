Based on your 5 favorite artists/genres/songs, here are the 100 songs that you're likely to also enjoy!

## Why (purpose)
To always have 100 songs that you're like to enjoy and know how they're related to one another ðŸ”Ž ðŸ¤¨

## What (requirements)
- **Data Warehouse:** Structured data of the 10,000 most popular songs on Spotify
- **Data Integration** Data fetching mechanism that talks to the Spotify Web API every day
- **Data Analytics:** A playground for us to run SQL queries and answer questions about those 10,000 songs
- **AI / ML:** Now, how are those 10,000 songs similar to and different from one another? And in what ways?
  - maybe: integrate with [DataRobot](https://www.datarobot.com/)
